# Ori DE TAS
Tool Assisted Modification for Ori and the Blind Forest DE

Open Ori in your Steam directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ori DE\)

### Setup
	Copy Assembly-CSharp.dll and OriDETAS.dll to (Ori DE\Ori_Data\Managed\) from the above directory.
	
	Make sure to backup the original Assembly-CSharp.dll before hand.

If you are going to playback a TAS file that is already created copy the file to (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ori DE\) and make sure it is named 'Ori.tas'
